# Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet (Codecademy)
This project is a basic webpage that outlines how to use the `position` property in css. It is an opened ended project with the aim of applying learned knowledge from the [Front End Engineer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/front-end-engineer).

I heavily explored design in this project – focusing on my CSS, I did my own research into animating to get the title's effect. This project helped me expand my knowledge, as well as apply the theory I already had, as whilst revising a topic I didn't feel entirely confident on.
