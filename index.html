    <!-- Table -->
        <div class="table in">
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <th id="property-heading">Property</th>
                    <th>Use</th>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <!-- Static -->
                    <tr>
                        <td class="property">static</td>
                        <td>
                            this is the default state of an element. an element with this position is always positioned 
                            according to the normal flow of the page.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <!-- Relative -->
                    <tr>
                        <td class="property">relative</td>
                        <td>
                            an element with this position is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. setting top, right, 
                            bottom, and left properties will cause the element to be adjusted away from its normal position. other content will not 
                            be adjusted to fit.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <!-- Fixed -->
                    <tr>
                        <td class="property">fixed</td>
                        <td>
                            an element with this position is positioned relative to the viewport &mdash; this means it will 
                            remain in the same place even during scrolling. it does not leave a gap where it would normally be located.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <!-- Absolute -->
                    <tr>
                        <td class="property">absolute</td>
                        <td>
                        an element with this position is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor &#40;with a position 
                        other than static&#41;. however, if there are no such positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves 
                        along with page scrolling. these are removed from the normal document flow and can overlap elements.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <!-- Sticky -->
                    <tr>
                        <td class="property">sticky</td>
                        <td>
                            an element with this position toggles between relative and fixed positioning, depending on the scroll position. 
                            a sticky element is positioned relative until a certain scroll point is reached, in which it &quot;sticks&quot; 
                            in that place.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
